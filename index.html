						<p>Many small businesses owners think that SEO is too expensive for them and requires a monthly budget of thousands of dollars. But it&rsquo;s not true. You can optimize your website and pages to get better traffic and sales without spending a lot of money on <a href="https://grownle.com/">monthly SEO packages</a> or hiring an SEO agency.</p>
						<p>In this post, we will discuss in detail some of the smart and excellent strategies to save money on SEO. So, let's get started:</p>
						<h3><strong>1. Start With Keyword Research</strong></h3>
						<p>If you want to save money on SEO, you need to compile a list of all the keywords that you want to target in your content. When you know what keywords you want to target, now it&rsquo;s time to find out which keywords are profitable for your business.</p>
						<p>You should use Google Keyword Planner to check search volumes of different keywords and select those keywords that have decent search volume (1000+ monthly searches) with low competition.</p>
						<h3><strong>2. Use Google Webmaster Tools &amp; Google Analytics</strong></h3>
						<p>If you're not using Google Webmaster Tools and Analytics, you should start right away. Both of these tools are free and easy to set up.</p>
						<p>Google Analytics will show you the number of visitors to your website, where they came from, and what actions they took while on your site. This information can help you work out if your paid links or social media marketing campaigns are working.</p>
						<p>Google Webmaster Tools can show you any errors that are preventing search engines from finding and crawling your website correctly. It can also show you the keywords that people have used to find your website, which can guide your future content creation strategy.</p>
						<h3><strong>3. Use Google Calendar for Content Creation Ideas</strong></h3>
						<p>One of the first things you should do is set up a Google Calendar for content creation ideas. This will help you keep track of your content and make sure it gets posted on time.</p>
						<p>You can use Google Calendar to create content ideas for your blog or social media account. You can also use it to schedule interviews and brainstorm ideas with other people in the industry.</p>
						<h3><strong>4. Create a List of Competitors&rsquo; Keywords and Use Them in Your Content Strategy</strong></h3>
						<p>Another great way to get more traffic from SEO is by using your competitors&rsquo; keywords in your content strategy. There are many tools available online that will help you find out what keywords your competitors are using.</p>
						<h3><strong>5. Cut Off the Expensive Tools</strong></h3>
						<p>There are tons of amazing tools out there, but they're not all great for smaller businesses or entrepreneurs. For example, SEMrush and Ahrefs- these tools cost $100 or more per month! That might be reasonable if you're working with a large company and have full-time staff on SEO, but it's not reasonable if you're just starting out and trying to keep your costs low.</p>
						<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of other tools out there that do the same thing and cost less than $10/month! For example- Keywords Everywhere, Uber suggest, etc.</p>
						<p>Therefore, you can seamlessly opt for any of these strategies to save money on SEO. But if you lack time, then of course it&rsquo;s better to trust <a href="https://grownle.com/">exceptional monthly packages</a> on SEO.</p>
